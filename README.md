This is my first Swift project which is the result of a problem I constantly have - my Mac shutting down because of low battery. Some people may understand me: You're doing some really important work and the battery warning at 5% pops up. "Just a minute. Let me finish this!" - the result: You forget to charge and your Mac shuts down. 

ChargeMe solves this problem by sending you a notification with every percentage drop after the low battery warning from macOS to remind you of charging.

After launching the app, ChargeMe sits in your menu bar indicated by the lightning symbol. In there, you can see your current charge level or quit the app.
