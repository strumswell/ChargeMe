# ![logo](https://i.imgur.com/DFiWFte.png) ChargeMe - A macOS charging reminder

This is my first Swift project which is the result of a problem I constantly have - my Mac shutting down because of low battery. 
You normally get a notification when your Mac hits 5% but if you're like me, you just ignore it because you can still use your Mac for some time with 5%.
This results in me forgetting about the low battery until my Mac shuts down without any warning!

<b>ChargeMe solves this problem by sending you a notification with every percentage drop after the 5% notification from macOS.</b>

After launching the app, ChargeMe sits in your menu bar indicated by the lightning symbol. In there, you can see your current charge level or quit the app.
